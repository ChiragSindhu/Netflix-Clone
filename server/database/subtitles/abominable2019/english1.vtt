1
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.490
Mmm.

2
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.030
Hmm?

3
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.670
Yes, Mr. Burnish,
the venue is completely sold out.

4
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.320
This is the most important
discovery of the century...

5
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.920
...and everyone
wants to see it.

6
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.490
Yes, the press will be there.

7
00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.630
This is your big day,
Mr. Burnish.

8
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.759
You won't be disappointed.
I promise.

9
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.350
Easy. Easy, boy.

10
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.190
Code red!

11
00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.940
Who left the enclosure open?

12
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.430
- There!
- Stay back!

13
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.440
- There he is!
- Get him!

14
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.380
All right, move in slowly.

15
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.760
No sudden movements.

16
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.020
What's happening?

17
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.060
Oh!

18
00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.290
Um...

19
00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.950
Who's telling Mr. Burnish?

20
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.870
Huh?

21
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.260
Oh...

22
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.350
On your right.

23
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.340
- Hey, wanna shoot some hoops?
- Maybe later.

24
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.019
Number two, extra spicy.

25
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.089
Nah. Nah,
I'm going out with Peilin,

26
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.339
but, uh,
maybe I'll stop by.

27
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.470
Aw, it would be
so fun if you could come!

28
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.680
Yi! I'm leaving
for work. Yi?

29
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.770
Are you awake?

30
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.690
Bye, everybody.
Have a great day!

31
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.490
Hey!

32
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.400
What are you supposed to be?
A famous person now?

33
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.610
Where are you going?

34
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.200
- I've got stuff to do.
- Stuff?

35
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.990
What is this stuff?
It's summer holiday.

36
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.580
Either be busy or be on holiday,
that is what I say.

37
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.020
- Be careful out there.
- Of course.

38
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.710
- Be back before dinner.
- I'll try.

39
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.000
- Warm enough?
- Toasty.

40
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.170
- No boys.
- What? No. No boys.

41
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.340
Do you need any money?

42
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.170
Mom. Nai Nai.
I've got it covered.

43
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Bye.

44
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.300
Okay. Bye.

45
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.770
What on earth do you
think she does all day?

46
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.230
Whoa!

47
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.330
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

48
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.520
Heel!

49
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.330
- Would you guys give me a break?
- Hey!

50
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.730
Whoa. Whoa!

51
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.190
Oh, my babies!
Money transfer?

52
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.160
Sorry. Cash only.

53
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.780
We'll be back
in a few hours.

54
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.420
Hey, cutie.

55
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.880
You're not my mom!

56
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.980
So, Jin, are you going to
Shuo's this weekend?

57
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.480
No. No, I'm heading to Beijing
to check out my school.

58
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.200
I'm, uh, pre-med.

59
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.990
- Nice!
- Oh, med school?

60
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.240
That's so hot.

61
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.290
I know, right?

62
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.790
Ugh, what's that...

63
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.370
smell?

64
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.960
She looks like
she slept in a dumpster.

65
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.300
Selfie!

66
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.890
He breaks left.

67
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.140
He breaks right.
He's going in for the dunk!

68
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.480
Whoa!

69
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.610
Hey, Yi.

70
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.900
Come shoot hoops
with me. Come on.

71
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.110
Sorry, Peng.
I don't have time.

72
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.490
Why don't you ask
the other kids?

73
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.030
The other kids
are too little.

74
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.820
And some of them
are freakishly good.

75
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.909
Come on, Yi, you never play
with me anymore.

76
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.460
Peng, I've been
busy all day.

77
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.880
Hey, your cousin will play with you.

78
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.340
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Light show starts at 8:00.

79
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.500
Ah, buh-bye.

80
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.750
As usual, he's got a date.

81
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.420
Wait, wait. Yi, watch.

82
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.730
Here we go.

83
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.180
Three, two, one.

84
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.440
Stop and check.

85
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.100
Hey, Yi, you know I can smell you
from all the way over here, right?

86
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.690
Like you can talk.

87
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.730
I'm sorry, is there any aftershave left or
did you use the whole bottle?

88
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.730
Why? You hoping
to borrow some?

89
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.990
Oof, not sure
it'll help.

90
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080
Very funny.

91
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.909
You guys wanna work out some of
this tension on the court?

92
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.990
Forget it, Peng.

93
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.750
We wouldn't want
to mess up Jin's hair.

94
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.080
And the new kicks.

95
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.580
No basketball for these babies.

96
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.960
Another time,
okay, cuz?

97
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.020
That's what you always say.

98
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.540
48 likes. Sweet!

99
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.350
Don't.

100
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.430
I know what you're thinking,
so just don't say it.

101
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.350
She's never
at home anymore.

102
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480
Ma...

103
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.060
That's all I'm gonna say.
Not another word.

104
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.730
So, that's it? We're just going
to give up on her?

105
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.020
I'd never
give up on Yi.

106
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.990
Look, we both know
what she's been going through.

107
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.400
She misses her dad.

108
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.870
We all do.

109
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.290
If we're patient and don't push her,
then just maybe...

110
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.740
Yi, is that you?

111
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.580
We've been waiting
for you to eat.

112
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.590
Oh, I ate on my way back.
So I'm good.

113
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.420
Either eat here or there,
but never on the move.

114
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.460
That is what I say.

115
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.350
Hey, Yi. Why don't we all sit down
together tonight as a family?

116
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.299
Family.

117
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.890
You need to eat.

118
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.770
You don't want to be
so short like your mother.

119
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.770
- Oh, I'm okay. Thank you, Nai Nai.
- Yi, wait.

120
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.940
What would you say to playing
a little violin for us after supper?

121
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.820
- Remember when you used to...
- I... I can't.

122
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.570
Can't? Why?

123
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.610
Because I...

124
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.490
I... I sold it.

125
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.450
I...

126
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.540
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.830
No.

128
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.760
I will take this trip.

129
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.900
Someday.

130
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.900
No, no, no.

131
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.890
Huh?

132
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.580
Hold up. Spotted something
at two o'clock.

133
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.280
There's nothing there.
Moving on.

134
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.520
Oh...

135
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.530
Hi, Mom. Bye, Nai Nai.

136
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.080
Excuse me.

137
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.130
Whoa.

138
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.090
Bam! It came
out of nowhere.

139
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.630
Then it was gone.

140
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.840
Did you see where it went?

141
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.510
Lady, I just told you.
It was gone.

142
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.800
What, uh...
What was it anyway?

143
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.970
Um, let me take care
of the repairs to your truck.

144
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.060
A little compensation
for your silence.

145
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200
It's a bribe.

146
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.920
Aah! Nai Nai,
that's weird.

147
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.250
Oh! So you're hungry now?

148
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.930
Oh, yeah.
Starving.

149
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.430
Let them cool.
You'll burn your mouth.

150
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.180
- I keep telling your mother you need to slow down.
- Ow. Ow.

151
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.680
- Spend more time here, at home with your family.
- Ow.

152
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.980
Mrs. Lui called me today,
says you're fixing her computer.

153
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.690
And Mrs. Yuan, in 4B,

154
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.820
says you're going to trim

155
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.700
her poodle's toenails.

156
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.790
I like that you're ambitious.

157
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.530
No one wants
a lazy granddaughter.

158
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.950
But busy, busy, busy.

159
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.290
What do you need to do
all that for?

160
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.420
I guess I just
like being busy.

161
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.510
Yi...

162
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.880
Can we just talk
about this later, Nai Nai?

163
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.470
You don't have to worry.

164
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.550
You should
listen to Nai Nai!

165
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.030
Hey, boy...

166
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.080
Or girl.

167
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.940
Are you hungry?

168
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.700
Whoa!

169
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.130
Whew.

170
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.670
Phew! Yeah,
you're definitely a boy.

171
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.150
Whoa.

172
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.210
I don't know
where you came from

173
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.420
but you sure
don't belong here.

174
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.590
You stay in here, okay?

175
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.970
There are people
looking for you.

176
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.180
Hmm...

177
00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.010
No, no, no. Okay. Okay.

178
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.190
No. Please don't cry.

179
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.320
Wait.

180
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.740
My dad used to play for me.
It always made me feel better.

181
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.700
All better, right?

182
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.220
Uh...

183
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.260
Hmm?

184
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.640
Nah.

185
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.810
Good night, sleepyhead.

186
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.450
Wait, do you
know that place?

187
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.080
Huh?

188
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.330
Is that your home?

189
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.290
Hmm.

190
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.460
You know, um, home.

191
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.980
No way.

192
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.020
Okay.

193
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.940
Come on.

194
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.480
Creature from Mount Everest.

195
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.860
"Considered to be no more
than fairy tale and myth,

196
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:26.320
"enthusiasts still hold out hope
that these creatures actually do exist."

197
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.360
There's a Yeti on my roof.

198
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.810
Captain, I am holding
you personally responsible

199
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.330
for that abominable
creature's escape.

200
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.590
Now, you will get every car
we have out there

201
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.970
or I will send you back to
your job at the shopping mall.

202
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.880
Uh, yes, sir.
Understood.

203
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.720
Attention, all units, we need
every car out on the street.

204
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.570
Hmm?

205
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.910
Mmm.

206
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.480
Huh?

207
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.040
Huh?

208
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.620
I was dribbling and the guy
was like, "Oh, no,"

209
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.330
and I was like, "Oh, yeah."

210
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.550
Want to play a game?

211
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.080
I can't.
Nai Nai will, though.

212
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.580
Hey, Nai Nai,
want to shoot some hoops?

213
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.670
You know I only
play for money.

214
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.680
Uh, something's missing.

215
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.350
What in the...

216
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.970
Peng! Go get your cousin Jin
and see who stole my air conditioner.

217
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.100
Go! Go, go, go, go!

218
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.780
Hey! Uh, what are you
doing out here?

219
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.310
Someone's gonna see you.

220
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.740
Where did you get that?

221
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.440
No, no, no!
Give it back now!

222
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.370
Do you hear me? Let go!

223
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.870
Peng,
that does not make sense.

224
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.500
Why would they
take it to the roof?

225
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.230
- Guys, what are you doing up here?
- Whoa! Hey! Hey!

226
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.480
- Get away from her!
- No, no, no! Wait!

227
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.120
Okay, I'm calling
the police.

228
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.130
- Hello? Yes, um...
- No! Jin, don't!

229
00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.540
There's a wild beast
on our roof.

230
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.550
Hang up, Jin!

231
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.720
- No, no, stop, Jin!
- Yes, a wild beast!

232
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.880
Turn up that scanner.

233
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.790
{\i1}Yeah, yeah,
on Heping Road. Please hurry!{\i0}

234
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.470
That's him. That's the Yeti.
Ring Mr. Burnish.

235
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.180
Jin, what have you done?
He's not dangerous.

236
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.440
Look at him. He's a Yeti!

237
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.900
Cool!

238
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.690
What? No. Yetis don't exist.

239
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.820
Oh, no!
They're back!

240
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.160
You have to go.
Go. Run. Now! Go!

241
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.330
Wait, wait. No, no, no.

242
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.750
No. No. No.

243
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.270
Wait!

244
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.380
Yi!

245
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.850
- He stole Yi.
- More like kidnapped.

246
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.270
Come on, Peng.

247
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.530
Yi!

248
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.610
Oh! We're never gonna
catch up to them.

249
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.200
Hey, Jin.

250
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.420
Hey, girls.

251
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.160
Whoo! How many girlfriends
do you have?

252
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.840
Hurry!

253
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.090
Whoa!

254
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.180
They're gaining on us.

255
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.440
Locked on target.

256
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.270
Dude. You darted Dave.

257
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.160
Uh... Yeah,
we lost them.

258
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.570
I want eyes on that target
at all times.

259
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.610
It cannot leave the city.

260
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.000
Watch out!

261
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.080
Hold on, Peng.

262
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.830
There! There they are.

263
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.010
Whoa!

264
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.140
Whew.

265
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.930
I think we lost them.

266
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.540
Look, down there!

267
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.180
That boat's leaving the city.
You have to get on it.

268
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.830
Get into position.

269
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.210
- Oh, there she is!
- Oh, my gosh!

270
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.620
{\i1}Take the shot.{\i0}

271
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.660
What? There's a girl with him?

272
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.630
Oh, no. How is she
gonna get away?

273
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.260
- Wait. What time is it?
- 8:00. Why?

274
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.520
Time for the light show!

275
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.400
Ooh! Ah!

276
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.990
Come on, Yi.

277
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.780
Where are they?

278
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.950
They're gone.

279
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.240
Copy that.
They're gone. And I'm dead.

280
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.450
Don't rub it in.

281
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.330
Come on!
Keep searching!

282
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.670
Oh!

283
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.300
There they are.
Come on, Peng.

284
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.970
Over there. That one.

285
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.730
You have to get on that boat.
When that boat lands, don't stop.

286
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.860
Don't stop until you reach your mountain.
Don't stop until you're home.

287
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.820
Okay? Home.

288
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.070
You have to go. Now!

289
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.580
Huh?

290
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.830
Hide!

291
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.920
Yi!

292
00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.010
Yi, are you okay?

293
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640
Oh, no!

294
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.470
Oh, no, no, no, Yi.
Don't you dare.

295
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.140
Yi!

296
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.080
I guess I'm coming
with you, huh?

297
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.540
Everest?

298
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.120
Yi?

299
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.330
Yi, are you crazy?

300
00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.080
- Wait for me!
- Peng? Peng! No!

301
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.420
No, no, no!

302
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.550
Peng! I'm responsible for you!

303
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.220
Your mom's
gonna kill me!

304
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.020
My babies.

305
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.650
No, no, no. You think
this is funny?

306
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.030
Do you even know
how much I paid for these?

307
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.410
What were you thinking, Yi?
You have gotten me into so much trouble.

308
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.280
I am so mad
at you right now.

309
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.020
You know what? I can't even
talk to you right now.

310
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.330
That's how mad I am!

311
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.350
The unveiling
is in one week, Captain.

312
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.810
Now, how am I supposed
to prove the Yeti exists

313
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.570
when I don't have a Yeti?

314
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.820
Uh...

315
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.570
No speaking! Only leaving.

316
00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.030
Doctor Zara,
what am I going to do?

317
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.660
The science community will be there,
the press will be there

318
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.340
the world will be there,
watching with their eyes.

319
00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.750
Mr. Burnish,

320
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.760
there are many rare
and exotic animals

321
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.380
you have collected
over the years.

322
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.960
These snakes, for example.

323
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.470
You're the only one
in the world

324
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.300
to have a newly born clutch
of rare Whooping snakes.

325
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.730
Down! Down! Down!

326
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.890
Go in your hole,
you weird snakes.

327
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.650
Sir, please. These creatures
are to be respected.

328
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:23.650
Hmm.

329
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.230
They would make a lovely belt.

330
00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.520
Mr. Burnish,
they are one of a kind.

331
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.530
A one-of-a-kind whooping belt.

332
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.150
A belt that goes "whoop."
Do I want that? I don't know.

333
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.210
Take them away.

334
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.500
Wait, how many snakes
are there supposed to be?

335
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.050
Uh... Why?

336
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.170
We promised the public a Yeti,
and nothing else will do.

337
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.300
Nothing!

338
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:53.470
I don't care if the Yeti is dead
or alive, I just need him.

339
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.430
Your gerbil
is freaking me out.

340
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.640
Jerboa.

341
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.350
Duchess is an albino jerboa
and she, too, is one of a kind.

342
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.700
Sir, as a zoologist,
it is my mission in life

343
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.820
to make sure that
all animals are protected

344
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.110
especially the rare
and exotic ones.

345
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.280
That is the only reason
I agreed to find your Yeti.

346
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.700
And you did.

347
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.620
For a few short days,
we had one.

348
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:23.340
But I cannot go to that
unveiling empty-handed.

349
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.050
I will not be made
into a laughingstock again.

350
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.680
Not, not, not!

351
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.260
Uh, there's news,
Mr. Burnish.

352
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.420
News about you leaving?

353
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.220
A dock worker saw a creature and some kids
boarding a cargo barge last night.

354
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.220
Doctor Zara, you are
the best in your field.

355
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.440
- Please, help me get him back.
- Under one condition.

356
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.650
We bring the Yeti
back alive.

357
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.270
You have to promise me
he will not be harmed.

358
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.700
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

359
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.740
Captain, where did
that boat land?

360
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.990
Uh...

361
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.200
Yeah, Ma.
Beijing is, um, great.

362
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.210
The dorms...
The dorms are clean.

363
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.590
- Peng? Oh, Peng is, uh...
- Look at all those teeth.

364
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.380
Peng's fine.

365
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:08.470
Hey, hey.

366
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.920
Oh, and Yi came, too.

367
00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.260
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

368
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.920
She's, uh, checking out
the university.

369
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.310
Soda? Oh, yeah!

370
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.180
Mom never lets me have any.

371
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.650
Catch!

372
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.650
Hey, Everest,
come over here.

373
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.070
How long
will we be here?

374
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.440
Oh.

375
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.580
Excuse me!
Cafeteria food is a little rich.

376
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.280
Well, I gotta go,
Ma. Bye.

377
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.790
I cannot believe that you made me
lie to my mother!

378
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.290
I love this stuff!

379
00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.050
Hey, okay, Everest, look.

380
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.130
First, you go over
the Yellow Mountain.

381
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.880
Then to the Yangtze River

382
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.350
and that river will take you
most of the way to the Himalayas

383
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.350
and finally to Mount Everest.

384
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.350
This is how you're
gonna get home.

385
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.930
Whoa, wait.

386
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.940
Mount Everest? No, no.
That has to be hundreds of miles away.

387
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.610
Actually, it's thousands.

388
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.270
Whoo!

389
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.160
I just hope he can
make it all that way.

390
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.650
Um, he seems capable.

391
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.580
Look at all those people.

392
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.840
- Hello!
- Peng, get down!

393
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.920
Ow.

394
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.550
Huh?

395
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.430
Yeah. We should hide.

396
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.940
Wait, why are we
still moving?

397
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.650
Uh...

398
00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.200
'Cause we're not
at the dock anymore.

399
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.650
What? Ahh!

400
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.410
No!

401
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.750
You know, I've never
been out of the city.

402
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.830
Wow.

403
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.370
I can't believe
how beautiful it is out here.

404
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.880
I can't believe I haven't eaten
in 24 hours.

405
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.130
I'm starving.

406
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.469
Uh-oh.

407
00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.969
Guys, I gotta go.

408
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.590
Just hold it.

409
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.980
Oh, no. He's gotta go.

410
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.429
- Get me out of here!
- I can't!

411
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.650
Out of my way!

412
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.440
Gotta go! Gotta go!

413
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.440
My head.

414
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.030
- I'm good.
- Okay.

415
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.320
Come on. Come on. Come on.

416
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.000
One bar. Okay,
that's good enough.

417
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.870
- Good enough for what?
- To buy tickets home.

418
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.340
Okay, look, the next boat
leaves around 5:00

419
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.170
so let's hope that's enough time
to find our way back to the dock.

420
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.130
Peng, come on.
We're leaving.

421
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.380
Yes, waiter.
I'm ready to order.

422
00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:59.920
I'll have some of Nai Nai's
pork buns with extra pork.

423
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.590
All right, get up, Peng.
We gotta go.

424
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.390
And a side of pork.

425
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.110
Why is he making that...

426
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.690
- Jin!
- Is he humming?

427
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.700
What's going on? Whoa.

428
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.290
What is happening?

429
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.550
Whoa! Is that a...

430
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.040
A blueberry?

431
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.630
Food!

432
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.680
Guys, these are delicious.

433
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.600
That doesn't make any sense.
No, no. This is not possible.

434
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.360
It's not funny, all right?
This is cashmere!

435
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.940
Uh, Jin...

436
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.360
Now what?

437
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.740
Oh.

438
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.410
Everest, do something!

439
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.420
Run!

440
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:17.550
Incoming!

441
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.550
- Run!
- Go faster!

442
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.130
Oh, no!

443
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.890
Save yourselves!

444
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.560
I'm hit!
Tell Nai Nai's pork buns I love them.

445
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.910
Hey, Jin, did you get
enough to eat?

446
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.540
Let's just say...

447
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.340
I've got blueberries in places
where blueberries should never be.

448
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.260
Come on, Everest.

449
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.890
Okay, watch and learn.

450
00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:13.640
Bank shot.

451
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.190
Ahh!

452
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.150
I'm exhausted.

453
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.360
What? Why are you stopping?

454
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.440
Because in about
five minutes,

455
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.680
we won't be able to see our
hands in front of our faces.

456
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.290
And that is exactly why we've got
to keep moving. All right?

457
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.570
Come on, Peng, we need to get
back to that dock...

458
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:37.250
- First thing in the morning.
- Yes!

459
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.140
- There's so many.
- Bugs?

460
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.760
Stars.

461
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.220
How come
they're only swarming me?

462
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.590
Maybe they're ladybugs.

463
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.230
"Lady..."
Not funny.

464
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.060
Well, my mom told me that the stars are
our ancestors who always watch over us.

465
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.480
My mom
says that, too.

466
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.610
My backpack? Peng!

467
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.650
No, no, no!

468
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.620
Great. No reception.

469
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.780
I'm entirely cut off
from my social life.

470
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.240
Mmm, how traumatic.

471
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.740
Yeah, Yi, it is.

472
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.090
Because, unlike you,
I like having friends.

473
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:19.670
I'm not some kind of a...

474
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.010
Loner? Is that what
you were going to say?

475
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.090
Well, for your info,

476
00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.460
I'm a self-proclaimed loner.
There's a difference, okay?

477
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.020
Fine, because in the morning,
Peng and I are headed back to the city.

478
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.220
- I can't leave him.
- Yi...

479
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.810
You've seen
what he can do.

480
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.980
He's amazing. He's magical.

481
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.400
Oh, so now
he's a magical Yeti.

482
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.310
Do you realize
how crazy you sound?

483
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.610
Look what happened
with the blueberries.

484
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.240
That wasn't him.
That was a natural phenomenon.

485
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.860
Just one that
I can't explain yet.

486
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.870
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

487
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.880
Go!

488
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.250
Hey, you cheated!

489
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.930
Will you two please
just give it a rest?

490
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.690
Oh, my gosh, I'm beginning
to sound like my parents.

491
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.480
Oh, that's it!

492
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.720
That's why they
get along so well.

493
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.980
Everest is just a kid.

494
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.420
He's probably like the same age
as Peng, but in Yeti years.

495
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.030
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

496
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.530
Right. There's no way
that giant thing is a kid.

497
00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.280
Wait. I'll prove it to you.

498
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.070
Everest, come over here.

499
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.410
Hmm?

500
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.630
This is you.

501
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.960
And your parents.

502
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.390
Aw. You have
your mother's eyes.

503
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.850
Don't worry.
I will make sure you get home.

504
00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.000
What are you going to do?

505
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.810
Take him all the way
back to Mount Everest?

506
00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.940
Maybe I am.

507
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.520
Jin, he needs to get
back to his family.

508
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.570
What about your family?
Don't they need you, too?

509
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.110
Always busy, never home.
What's that all about, Yi?

510
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.900
Don't talk to me about family.

511
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.280
You have no idea! No idea!

512
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.540
Your life is so easy, Jin.

513
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.950
Do you even want to be a doctor
or do you just think that you'll...

514
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
I don't know, you'll
look good in white?

515
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.540
All right. Call me shallow
all you want.

516
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.210
At least
I'm not delusional.

517
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.720
I don't care if you
think I'm crazy.

518
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.300
You're impossible.

519
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.200
Huh?

520
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.040
Is that Yi?

521
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.760
Wait, don't stop.
It's really good.

522
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.940
Your Nai Nai said you stopped
playing after your dad died.

523
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.850
- Peng!
- It's okay, Jin. Really.

524
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.940
Was this your dad's violin?

525
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.530
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.940
You know, I really
liked your dad.

527
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.020
Thanks, Peng.

528
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.450
Well, we better head out if we're going
to make it to the Yangtze River.

529
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.200
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

530
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.450
I checked and Dahe village has boats
leaving for the city every hour.

531
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.000
Okay, well, when we get there,
you and Peng can take a boat back

532
00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:50.380
but I'm going to
take Everest home.

533
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:01.930
Well, that boat
pulled in yesterday morning

534
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.600
but we've unloaded all of the cargo
and didn't find anyone.

535
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.760
Would you mind
if we search it again?

536
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.110
- You got anything?
- No, Captain.

537
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.100
- He was here?
- Yes.

538
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.940
And it looks like
he fancies soda.

539
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.460
Stop!

540
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.290
Down there!

541
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.710
What was that?

542
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.550
Sorry, Doctor, there's no sign
of 'em anywhere.

543
00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.930
Sir, the Yeti has disappeared.

544
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.220
It has been so long since
I've been out in nature.

545
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.510
- Sir, if we...
- Look at this tree.

546
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.640
It's a wonderful tree.

547
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.600
Look at the colors.

548
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.140
I love this tree.

549
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.170
You there, chop it down
and put it in a bag, will you?

550
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.110
Right away, sir.

551
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.730
I want it in my penthouse...

552
00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.650
To be with me.

553
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:00.990
Mr. Burnish!

554
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.580
Right! What? What is it?

555
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.350
We should divide the team
and cover some ground.

556
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.160
Captain, let us fan out.

557
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.080
Yes, sir.

558
00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.880
Now, on the map, that village
is only a centimeter away.

559
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.890
That can't be that far.

560
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.170
It must just be
on the other side of the...

561
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.470
The Yellow Mountain.

562
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.730
Wow.

563
00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.220
Wait. Wait.
We are not going over that.

564
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.480
Come on, Everest,
I'll race you!

565
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.650
Hey, you guys,
wait right there!

566
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.410
Ooh.

567
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.490
Everest, look. Make a wish.

568
00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.040
No, no. They're for wishing.

569
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.130
Leg cramp.
Stop for a sec.

570
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.460
Okay. I mean,
if you really need to.

571
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.970
I wish I was
a basketball superstar.

572
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:12.180
Starting in the championship game,
the mighty Peng!

573
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.030
Hmm?

574
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.570
Wait, is that a drone? Cool!

575
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.700
Okay. Not so cool!
Not so cool!

576
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.410
Oh, no. It's those guys
from the city.

577
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.700
I told you
this was a crazy idea.

578
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.450
Captain, I have footage.

579
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.670
Copy that.

580
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.580
Those little thieves
stole my Yeti!

581
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.500
- Get us there.
- Keep your eyes on 'em.

582
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.840
We're on our way.

583
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.890
Uh... What now?

584
00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.330
I wish there was
a way out of here.

585
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.350
Uh... What's going on?

586
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.440
Whoa.

587
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.810
Yi, let go of that!
It's dangerous!

588
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.180
Everest, are you sure
about this?

589
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.030
No, Peng! Get down from there
right now! Hey, Peng!

590
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.070
- Jin! Jump!
- Jump!

591
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.070
No, get down here!
Give me your hand!

592
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.410
Got ya!

593
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.820
Meet me at that village
by the river!

594
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.990
We'll be there!

595
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.200
And take care of Peng!

596
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.040
Whoa.

597
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.360
Whoa. Everyone, push!

598
00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:38.980
Uh-oh.

599
00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.750
- Are you catching this?
- Is that a giant dandelion?

600
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.490
Giant dandelions?

601
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.370
Look, stop messing about
and get my Yeti!

602
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:58.620
Uh, yes, sir.

603
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.040
Let's take 'em down.

604
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.720
Yeah! Take that, drones!

605
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.860
So, who's going
to tell Mr. Burnish?

606
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:23.940
Not it!

607
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.360
- Help!
- Wait, where are we going?

608
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.910
I hope you're not hurt.
Let me introduce myself.

609
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.040
- I'm Doctor Zara.
- I know who you are.

610
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.960
- You do?
- Yeah.

611
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.370
You're the bad guys.

612
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.130
Your gerbil is
freaking me out.

613
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.220
A boy that knows his gerbils.
I like him.

614
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.880
Bad? Listen,
you've got this all wrong.

615
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:54.260
That wild beast is
unpredictable, even dangerous.

616
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.730
We were trying to rescue your friend
when the Yeti kidnapped her.

617
00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.190
He did kidnap her.

618
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.610
Listen, you twit!

619
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.780
I own that Yeti. He is my Yeti.
I want my Yeti back!

620
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.950
Right? Just nod.

621
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.740
Mr. Burnish, please!

622
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.450
Ow.

623
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.360
All right, look.

624
00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.160
I just need to find
my cousin and my friend

625
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:18.930
and get 'em back
to the city in one piece.

626
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.960
I can get all of you
back to the city

627
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:25.210
but the only way I can help your friends
is if I know where they are.

628
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.680
Do you know?

629
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.130
That Yeti is the pinnacle
of my research.

630
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.350
I really need him back.

631
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.480
I don't know where they are

632
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.730
but I do know
where they will be.

633
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.320
Brace yourselves!

634
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.950
Everest!

635
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.200
- Huh?
- No, over here!

636
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.710
Huh?

637
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.340
That was amazing, Everest.

638
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.550
You saved us.
And now, we're...

639
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:13.970
Where are we?

640
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.850
All I know is we're
a long way from Jin.

641
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.190
Yeah, well, that's his fault.
He should have jumped.

642
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.060
I mean, why doesn't he
ever just jump?

643
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.900
He did. He jumped on that boat
back in the city.

644
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.570
That's what got him on this trip
in the first place.

645
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.660
Yeah, but that's because
he was worried about you.

646
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.820
You're his family.

647
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.200
Yi, he thinks of you
as family, too.

648
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.440
Wh... What?

649
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.710
Hey, little turtle.

650
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.130
Everest...

651
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.500
Jin said Yi was like his little sister
when they were kids.

652
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.470
She was always doing something crazy that
would get her into trouble,

653
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.720
so he had to
watch out for her.

654
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.760
And he still does.

655
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.840
I think
we should get going.

656
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.900
But don't worry. I can get us
out of here. Let's go.

657
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.700
Put 'em down, Everest.

658
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.930
Suddenly, I saw it.

659
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.430
A Yeti. A real Yeti.

660
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.930
Cold eyes staring.

661
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.270
It tried to kill me.

662
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.400
I needed to protect myself.
I swung my ice axe...

663
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.780
And it was gone.

664
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.030
No footprints. Nothing.

665
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.080
I rushed back to tell the world
what had happened but without proof...

666
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.780
They laughed at me.

667
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.710
They laughed at me.

668
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.750
You spent all these years
trying to get your proof?

669
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.370
Mmm-hmm.

670
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:14.920
I'm so used
to looking down on the world

671
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.430
it's amazing how small
one feels just by looking up.

672
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:24.340
Mr. Burnish, we need to get
an early start.

673
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.470
Thanks to Jin, we've learned
the Yeti's whereabouts.

674
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:29.220
Yes, yes.

675
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.570
Duchess. Is that your name?

676
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:38.360
You're kind of cute, you know,
in your own ugly, beady-eyed kind of way.

677
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.330
I can't feel my feet.

678
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:49.960
"Don't worry,
I'll get us out of here."

679
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:52.580
What was I thinking?

680
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.050
We are completely lost.

681
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.010
Everest is nowhere
near his mountain

682
00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.550
and for all we know, Jin could be
in trouble right now. And it's...

683
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.770
And it's all my fault.

684
00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.440
Jin said this trip
was a crazy idea.

685
00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:10.560
And, I don't know,
maybe he's right.

686
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.900
I mean, but...

687
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.480
We could sure
use him right now.

688
00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.820
Yeah. And the map
on his cell phone.

689
00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.700
It's okay, Everest.
It's just a koi fish.

690
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.120
That's weird.

691
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.960
Why are they swimming
against the current?

692
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.840
They're actually trying
to get back home.

693
00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.460
Ooh.

694
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.000
Yeah. Let's just
put him back.

695
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:37.510
Do you think
he'll make it?

696
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.130
Well, he's sure gonna try.

697
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.720
You know these fish are
the symbol of perseverance?

698
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.180
What?

699
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.390
It's just something
my mom told me.

700
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.730
It means that when
things get really tough...

701
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.820
They never give up.

702
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.820
You know what, guys?
We have to keep going.

703
00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.530
Come on. Come on,
you guys, let's go.

704
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.190
Everest, put the fish down.

705
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.950
Into the water.

706
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:22.470
Ow.

707
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:25.470
Get back,
you abominable creature!

708
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.680
Back!

709
00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.440
That's great. Of course.

710
00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.440
He said in
the sweetest little voice,

711
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:43.650
"You're cute in your own ugly,
beady-eyed kind of way."

712
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.820
Argh!

713
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.030
I tell you, he's going soft!

714
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.200
We need to act fast.

715
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.950
If that kid is right and we find
the Yeti at the river tomorrow,

716
00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:54.120
use any means possible
to take him down.

717
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.090
I thought we had
to keep the Yeti alive.

718
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.420
The buyer won't pay us
unless he's still breathing,

719
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.380
but if he's a little
banged up, who cares?

720
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.800
They're just gonna
chop him up into little pieces

721
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.170
for their experiments
anyway.

722
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.590
Well, what do we do
with the kids?

723
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.130
If you want your 10%,
you'll get rid of them.

724
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:10.220
For good!

725
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.190
Oh, and get rid of this rodent
I've been carrying around.

726
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.850
Do you know how hard it is to keep up
this British animal-lover act?

727
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.990
I'm done!

728
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:22.610
Duchess? But she's
a one-of-a-kind albino jerboa.

729
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.530
She's just a rat, you idiot!

730
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.490
Hey! My keys.

731
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:38.040
Here, I think you're
better off with this guy.

732
00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.300
Hmm. Not now.

733
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:48.550
All right, let's see.

734
00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.680
SUV? Too loud.

735
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.680
Transporter? No.

736
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.230
What's this one?

737
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.150
Sweet.

738
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:06.110
Check the hair.
Lookin' good, Jin.

739
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.160
Thanks, Jin.

740
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.860
All right, let's do this.

741
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.030
Oh.

742
00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:37.230
It's okay, babies.
It's okay, I got you.

743
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.540
Nope. Nope.
I can't do it.

744
00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:10.670
All right, fine,
just take it!

745
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.520
Be the koi fish.
Be the koi fish.

746
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:21.480
That's it, Peng.

747
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:23.730
You keep swimming.

748
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.650
What was that?

749
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.730
Come on!

750
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.190
All right! No more swimming!

751
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.120
Yeah, but,
how are we gonna catch it?

752
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.630
Whoo-hoo!

753
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.970
Now, this is the way
to travel!

754
00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.650
- Whoo-hoo.
- Ready, Everest?

755
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.270
Again.

756
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.690
You know, Everest...

757
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:10.980
I can't figure you out.
I mean, how do you do that?

758
00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.160
Oh!

759
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:14.820
Maybe it's his gift...

760
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.240
Like when you play the violin,
or when I play basketball.

761
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.780
Everest talks to nature.

762
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.210
Now, that? That is a gift.

763
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:47.570
Well, this is the village.

764
00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:48.820
Do you see Jin?

765
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.980
Through that mob?
Are you kidding me?

766
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.240
We need to both
look for him.

767
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.280
What about Everest?

768
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.150
Move it, yaks!

769
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:56.450
Oh. I've got an idea.

770
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.280
Grab all of that rope.

771
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.580
- Can you see anything?
- Nope.

772
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.920
Yi, there he is!

773
00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.010
Jin! Jin!

774
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.170
- We're gonna lose him.
- I'll run ahead.

775
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.220
Stay there and blend in.

776
00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:24.100
Oh, your yak
is odd-looking.

777
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.270
Hey, don't body-shame my yak.

778
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:29.570
Jin! Jin!

779
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:31.600
- Yes?
- Whoa.

780
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.150
I'm so sorry.

781
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:37.330
No.

782
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:39.620
Keep looking. He said
they would be here.

783
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.580
I can't believe
he crashed my bike.

784
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.620
- Look!
- Target spotted. Move out.

785
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.590
They found us.
Let's go! Go!

786
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:53.750
Go, Everest, go. Move it!

787
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:55.170
No. Oh, no.

788
00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:56.220
Hey, you!

789
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.140
- Need a ride?
- Jin?

790
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:02.730
- You showed up!
- Of course I did.

791
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.640
Wait, where's Peng?

792
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:07.940
Everest!

793
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:11.190
Oh, no!

794
00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.860
Coming in at 4'10"
and ready to take the game,

795
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.830
the mighty Peng!

796
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.740
High five! Yeah!

797
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:30.290
Whoo!

798
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.300
- Everest! Peng!
- Peng! Come on!

799
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:33.760
Jin, I knew you'd be here.

800
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.630
Good to see ya, cuz.

801
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.970
What happened
to your babies?

802
00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.050
Well, Peng...

803
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.220
My babies are all grown up.

804
00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.470
Hang on.

805
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.410
Captain, don't you dare
let them get away.

806
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.060
Hold on. This little lady
has a few tricks up her sleeve.

807
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.990
Whoa!

808
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.910
- Go faster!
- I'm trying!

809
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.120
Everest, do something.

810
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.050
Hurry, Everest!

811
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.380
- It's working!
- Uh...

812
00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.300
Oh, no. Guys. Guys!

813
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:26.940
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Turn, turn!

814
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.410
Whoa.

815
00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.150
This is unbelievable.

816
00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:50.450
Peng! Peng!
Look. It's okay.

817
00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.170
Wow!

818
01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.350
- This is amazing!
- This is impossible!

819
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.260
Come on, Everest,
make it go bigger!

820
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:15.230
Higher!

821
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.360
Slow down.

822
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:23.360
Slow down!

823
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.210
- Peng!
- Where is he?

824
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.260
Peng?

825
01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.520
Oh, no.

826
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.650
Everest, no. Everest.

827
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320
Hold it in.

828
01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.070
No, no!

829
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.450
Hey, Jin. You got a little
something right here.

830
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.000
Huh?

831
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.510
No.

832
01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.210
Oh, no.

833
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.380
No.

834
01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:30.810
Yi...

835
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.540
You okay?

836
01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.080
Yeah. Um...

837
01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.010
That violin meant
everything to me.

838
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.640
When we were little, you know,
my dad used to play all the time.

839
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:12.890
Um...

840
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:14.310
But every night...

841
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:18.060
When he was tucking me in,
he would play this one song

842
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:19.940
just for me.

843
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.740
And I don't know,
it made me feel like

844
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.450
everything was
gonna be okay.

845
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.330
Yi, I'm sorry.

846
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.920
I'm sorry for what I said.

847
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.630
"Too busy, never home."

848
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.050
No.
You're right.

849
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.580
I know I keep busy.

850
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:44.760
I just don't know why.

851
01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.590
I miss him,
and I don't wanna miss him,

852
01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:54.640
but I haven't even
cried yet, Jin.

853
01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:56.730
And my family...

854
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.480
We're all so distant,
and I...

855
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.650
Argh, I don't know.

856
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.560
I don't know what to do.

857
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:08.320
Well, are you sure they're
the ones who are distant?

858
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:15.700
But you were right
about me, too.

859
01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.870
Yeah, hate to admit it,
but I mean

860
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.400
that thought about looking good
in the white doctor's coat...

861
01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.880
It did cross my mind.

862
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.720
I am a horrible,
horrible person.

863
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.920
Yeah. You are the worst.

864
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.010
I really... I am.

865
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:35.270
Yi, listen,

866
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.760
if those people find Everest,
we're all in danger.

867
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.100
Wait, do they know
where I'm taking him?

868
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.730
They're headed
to the Himalayas, sir.

869
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.150
And the Yeti's powers
will grow even stronger

870
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.410
the closer he gets
to those mountains.

871
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:53.070
But there's still one more chance
to capture your Yeti.

872
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.490
At the foothills of those
mountains, there's a bridge.

873
01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:00.740
Once the Yeti crosses it,
he'll blend in, disappear.

874
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.710
We will never
find him again.

875
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.170
I've never seen powers
like those before.

876
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.550
It's intimidating.

877
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.260
Stay the course, sir.

878
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:13.770
After this, no one will
ever laugh at you again.

879
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:15.770
You're right.

880
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:19.060
Captain, we are going
to need reinforcements.

881
01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:22.350
Lots of reinforcements.

882
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.400
Yes, sir.

883
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.070
What do those powers
mean for us?

884
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.900
That Yeti's price tag
just doubled.

885
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.430
Hey, you guys,
did you find that thing?

886
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.900
We're working on it.

887
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:34.690
There it is!

888
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:35.860
There it is!

889
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.620
There it is!

890
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.080
Really, Dave?

891
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.830
Come on! Come quickly.

892
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.470
Everest?

893
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.470
You okay?

894
01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:00.810
- Is that...
- Yeti hair?

895
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.060
Yep.

896
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.870
See?
It's as good as new.

897
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.200
No.

898
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.660
It's better than new.

899
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.500
Hey! When did you
buy these?

900
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.340
Oh, I didn't buy them.

901
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.920
They were my dad's.

902
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:35.350
He kept postcards
of all the places

903
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.850
he wanted to take us someday,
the whole family.

904
01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.640
Yi, they're all of
the places we've been!

905
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:46.730
What?

906
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.810
No way. How is this possible?

907
01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:54.030
That can't be.

908
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.120
We've been
to all of these.

909
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:58.900
All but one.

910
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.410
The Leshan Buddha.

911
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.630
This is the place that my dad
wanted me to see the most.

912
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:17.550
This is incredible.

913
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.340
You brought me here,
didn't you?

914
01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.600
Whoa.

915
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.890
Impossible.

916
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:54.210
Whoa.

917
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:09.680
Wow!

918
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.480
I wish Dad were here
to see this.

919
01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:16.979
It's beautiful.

920
01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.279
Thank you, Everest.

921
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.569
You did that, Yi.
You did.

922
01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:29.290
I did that?

923
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:34.630
Whoa.

924
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.880
Come on, Everest.

925
01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.080
Yi...

926
01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:46.390
We are so going
to the Himalayas.

927
01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.270
Come on, you guys.

928
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.440
Whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay!

929
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.660
Hold on, Peng.
Whoo-hoo!

930
01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:58.450
Come on!

931
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.960
If we keep going, we'll get
to the Himalayas by morning.

932
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.920
Those guys are not gonna stop
until they get Everest...

933
01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:06.170
Is that better?

934
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.840
Maybe.

935
01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.770
- We still have to keep going though.
- I know.

936
01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.810
Will it be the same?
You know, when Everest goes home?

937
01:11:19.570 --> 01:11:20.930
With us, I mean.

938
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:23.360
Like, will you guys
still want to hang out?

939
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.020
Of course we will,
Peng.

940
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:29.400
You know, I'll sure miss
seeing these stars.

941
01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:32.080
Yeah, but even though
we can't see them,

942
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.530
we'll still know
they're there.

943
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.990
So that's kinda cool,
isn't it?

944
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.210
Yes, Peng,
that's very cool.

945
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.750
Hmm.

946
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.010
It's not funny.
Loch Ness Monster? Chupacabra?

947
01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.670
What if they exist?

948
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:54.050
Oh, my gosh, my whole life
has been a lie.

949
01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.410
Huh?

950
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.100
Wow. The Himalayas.

951
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.310
Whoa!

952
01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360
Awesome!

953
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:08.060
Everest, look!

954
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.690
Just across
that bridge is home!

955
01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:11.980
What are we waiting for?

956
01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.240
Let's go! Let's go!

957
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.920
Everest! Wait up!

958
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:27.630
Oh, no.

959
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.390
Move out!
Everyone, go!

960
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:31.430
Move it!

961
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:33.050
Go! Go back!

962
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.510
Whoa!

963
01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:38.730
Go! Go! Go!

964
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:39.940
Target spotted.

965
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.610
Everest, run!
Go to your mountain. Now!

966
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.620
Before it's too late.

967
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.070
Captain, hurry.

968
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.080
Get my Yeti! Get him now!

969
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.880
No, no, no!
You're going the wrong way!

970
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.660
Target's on the move!

971
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.400
It's amazing.

972
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.870
Mr. Burnish,
we're missing our chance.

973
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.450
Load tranq guns.

974
01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:46.130
Wait! Hold your fire!

975
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:57.850
Get back!

976
01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:08.770
{\i1}Mr. Burnish!{\i0}

977
01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.400
Take the shot!

978
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:13.900
Oh, no!

979
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.860
He's defending them.

980
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:18.370
Mr. Burnish!

981
01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.610
Mr. Burnish!

982
01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.750
Doctor, I was wrong.

983
01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.910
You were right.

984
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.340
The Yeti must be protected

985
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.630
and the best way to protect
the Yeti is to let him go.

986
01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.050
We must let him go.

987
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:40.810
Captain, order your men
to stow their weapons.

988
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:42.180
Do it, now!

989
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.480
Hmm. Quick!
Mr. Burnish needs help.

990
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.700
Captain...

991
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:03.670
Fire at will!

992
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.020
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire!

993
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:17.590
Everest!

994
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:29.520
- No!
- Get the kids.

995
01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780
Everest!

996
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:31.820
No! No!

997
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.020
- Everest!
- Stop!

998
01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:48.620
I'll make sure
the Yeti's out.

999
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:50.620
No!

1000
01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.960
You are never
going to escape again.

1001
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:57.470
Wait, wait, get her!

1002
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:58.470
Stop it!

1003
01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.970
Yi!

1004
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:01.600
Yi!

1005
01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:18.150
- No! No! No!
- Yi! No!

1006
01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.480
- Well, that's one down.
- Yi!

1007
01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.860
All right, move out.

1008
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:22.970
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.770
- Copy that. Moving out.
- Go back!

1010
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.780
- No! Yi!
- Go back! Yi!

1011
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.250
Stop the car!

1012
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.540
- It's Everest.
- No. This can't be happening!

1013
01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.360
- Let's go! Get out of here!
- Go, go, go!

1014
01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.750
Sir... Sir, wake up.

1015
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:48.420
Yi!
You're okay.

1016
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:49.720
Everest!

1017
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:57.430
I thought
we had to keep the Yeti alive.

1018
01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.770
Dead will have to do.

1019
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400
No!

1020
01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:06.520
Yes!

1021
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.790
No!

1022
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:24.630
Everest?

1023
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:33.350
Hmm.

1024
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.230
Everest?

1025
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.440
Everest?

1026
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:49.740
You are, by far, the most extraordinary
creature I have ever seen.

1027
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:55.580
That is exactly why the world
must never know you exist.

1028
01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.700
They would not understand.
I didn't.

1029
01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:06.040
Now, can I please help you
get back to the city?

1030
01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.380
Thank you...

1031
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:11.510
But I promised to take Everest home
and he's not home yet.

1032
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.640
You're going to take Everest
all the way to Everest?

1033
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:16.470
That is impossible.

1034
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.100
Sir, with all due respect,

1035
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:22.320
when Yi sets her mind on something,
nothing is impossible.

1036
01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:24.730
Yes.

1037
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.320
It's cold.

1038
01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.570
But there is something
I have to insist that I give you.

1039
01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.660
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1040
01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:34.660
See you later.

1041
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:37.990
Don't worry, I'll be waiting right here.

1042
01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:40.160
They just wanted
our coats, Dave.

1043
01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:43.250
Guys...

1044
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.910
It sure is a long way
up there.

1045
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:48.800
Everest?

1046
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.730
- Cool!
- All right. Bring it!

1047
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:15.490
Wow.

1048
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:32.430
Yeah!

1049
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.720
Whoa.

1050
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:40.850
Whoo!

1051
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:03.960
Everest, it's your mountain.

1052
01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.470
What do we do now?

1053
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.220
I don't know.

1054
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.910
Whoa.

1055
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:52.670
His parents.

1056
01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.800
Wow.

1057
01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.460
They'd be so good
at basketball.

1058
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.810
We're finally home, Everest.

1059
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.070
Home.

1060
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:16.860
I can't...

1061
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:18.570
I can't believe
the journey's over.

1062
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.850
You're right.

1063
01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.480
It's not over.

1064
01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:48.940
Thank you, Everest.

1065
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:54.810
I'll never
forget you, Everest!

1066
01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.510
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

1067
01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.470
- Bye! Thank you!
- Thank you!

1068
01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:21.780
Ma!

1069
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.950
Yi? You're back.

1070
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:26.110
How was the trip?

1071
01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:27.410
Aww.

1072
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.910
Yi?

1073
01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.590
I missed you both
so much.

1074
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.720
It's good to have you back,
granddaughter.

1075
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:45.340
Why don't you get that?
It's probably the boys.

1076
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.890
Who is ready
for Nai Nai's pork buns?

1077
01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.640
Look what I found
on your doorstep.

1078
01:25:50.690 --> 01:25:51.970
It's addressed
to all of us.

1079
01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.390
Shh!
Come over here.

1080
01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.920
Hey, kids...

1081
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:02.610
- ...how was Beijing?
- Peng.

1082
01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.950
Oh, it was, um,
life-changing.

1083
01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.610
Wow. That's great.

1084
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:08.990
Everybody, dig in.

1085
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.660
Mmm.

1086
01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:14.450
Wow. I totally see
what you mean

1087
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.060
- about these pork buns.
- Uh-huh.

1088
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:20.670
There is no one in the world who likes
these pork buns more than me.

1089
01:26:20.970 --> 01:26:23.760
Well, maybe one.

1090
01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:28.550
Who? Who else
like my buns?

1091
01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:32.720
- No laughing. I'm serious.
- Oh, Nai Nai.
