Hey, George.

186
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:37,979
Are you okay?

187
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,981
Do you need
a doctor?
Oh, no.

188
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,504
Nah, I was just...

189
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,158

Hey.

00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,829
Good news. Your
dad's doing okay

195
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,831
and should be home
in a couple of days.

196
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:04,919
Thank God.

197
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,398
Thank modern medicine.

198
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,835

Do you think
I gave Dad a heart attack?

What?

203
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,585
No.

204
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,848
This isn't your fault.

205
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,937
I was really mean to him.

206
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,547
I was mean to him as well.

207
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,201
What I did was so much worse.

208
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:28,464
That is true. When
we're receiving our punishment,

209
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,205
they should really
let you have it.

210
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:33,251
Okay, y'all go to sleep.But I was just
an accomplice.

211
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,557
It wouldn't be fair
if we got equal punishment.

212
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,863

230

happened the other night?

But in the absence

society's rules are what keeps
a person's morality in check.

it, and I'm not.

and I got away with it.

you have quite the potty mouth,

and yet you never seem to pay
a price for any of it.

321
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,167
Well, when you're cute like me,

322

a little different.

00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,519
Hmm. That would also explain

about it, so who knows?

[knocking]Yeah?

329
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,972
Can I talk to you?

330
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:22,105
Of course. What's up?

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,631
I feel really bad
about the other day.

Don't worry about it.

00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,161
But you were just trying to help
and then I yelled at you

335

You mean Marcus?

347
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:03,277
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

348
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,888
It's okay.

349
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,630
[sniffles]So, what happened?

350
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:11,111
You're not gonna
believe this,

351
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,418
but he was hanging out with
another girl behind my back.

Oh, well...

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,816
may-maybe they're
just friends.

hands at the roller rink.

Does that sound like
friends to you?

00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,735
Well... no.

Uh... no.

I mean, how could
he do this to me?

361
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,962
I thought I could trust him.

362
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,530

I wouldn't find out?

Hmm?I just wanted
to let you know

368

00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,262
Trying to fix this radio.

375
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,481
Should you be doing
that with a weak heart?

376
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,396
I'm just sitting here.

377
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,658
You look a little sweaty.

378
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,008
What do you want?

379
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,357
I'm gonna go hang
out with Jana.

380
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,925
Just wanted to make sure
you're doing okay.

381
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,274
Hold on.

382
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:28,971
Are you worried
I'm gonna have a heart attack

383
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:31,495
and interrupt "private time"
with your girlfriend?

384
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,975
Yes.

385
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,890
At least you're honest.

386
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,065
Glad you think so.

387

Bye.

Psst. George.

00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,341
How you doing?

392
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:52,864
Hanging in.So...

393
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:56,303
is it weird,
me coming over for dinner?

394
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,000
What do you mean?

395
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,481
You know exactly what I mean.

396
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,962
Brenda,
I had a lot to drink that night.

397
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,833
You know, I don't remember much.

398
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,357
You don't?

399
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,490
No, I do not.

400
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,102
Oh. Okay.

401
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,104
I guess I don't either.

402
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,411
Great. See you at dinner.

403
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,195
Yeah, mm-hmm.

404
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:25,462
SHELDON:
I still don't understand
why you'd rather work here

405
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:26,768
than be a physicist.

406
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,726
I'm enjoying the change of pace.

407
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,903
And they let me take home
all the expired food I want.

408
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:35,168
So, what brings
you here?Well, I did something wrong,

409
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,691
and yet I've received
no punishment.

410
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,127
What's my incentive
to behave morally

411
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,521
if the rules of society
aren't being enforced?

412
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:44,046
Reminds me of the Ring of Gyges.

413
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,396
I'm not familiar
with the Ring of Gyges.

414
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,616
Oh, it's
a delightful brainteaser.

415
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:50,792
Plato asked the question:

416
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:54,056
If you could wear a ring
that made you invisible,

417
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,885
what would prevent you
from committing

418
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,757
the most horrendous crimes?

419
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,716
Sounds an awful lot
like the Ring of Sauron

420
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,283
in The Lord of the Rings.

421
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:06,634
Oh. I'm not familiar
with The Lord of the Rings.

422
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,462
Oh, it's a delightful series
of fantasy books

423
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:10,768
in which there's a ring
that makes the wearer invisible

424
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:12,770
but also leads
to moral corruption.

425
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,904
Ooh. Perhaps you
should read Plato,

426
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,733
and I should read
The Lord of the Rings.

427
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,604
You should really start
with The Hobbit.

428
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,128
What's a hobbit?

429
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:24,304
It's a race of short humanoids
who live in burrows

430
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:25,348
and have hairy feet.

431
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,698
Oh. I've been called that.

432
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,397
But I never knew what it was.

444
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,426
Brenda can't make it to dinner.

445
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,949
She's not feeling well.

446
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,560

450
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:11,525
Yeah. I was a little out of it
at the hospital.

451
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,092

But nothing actually happened.

472
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,108
There's no reason
to feel guilty.

473
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,284
Okay.I mean,

474
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,373
did we have too much
to drink? Sure.

Did-did we talk about going home
from the bar together?

476
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:23,988
Okay, I'm sorry about that.No need to apologize,
'cause we didn't go.

All we did was have a nice time

Is there anything wrong
with that?
