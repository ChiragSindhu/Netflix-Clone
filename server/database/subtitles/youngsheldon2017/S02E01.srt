It's coffee.

363
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,363
Where'd you get it?

364
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:30,973
The teachers' lounge.
And before you ask,

365
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,976
no, I'm not the world's
greatest grandpa.

366
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,499
Since when do you drink coffee?

367
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,675
I don't,
but this job is killing me.

368
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,329
You wouldn't understand.

369
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,505
[sips, coughs]

370
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,159
You realize I have a job.

371
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,118
At your parents'
convenience store?

372
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,510
That doesn't count.

373
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,947
Why not?

374
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,165
You get to sit
at a cash register

375
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,819
and have the fun of doing math.

376
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:53,126
Actually,
the cash register tells you

377
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:54,344
how much change to give.

378
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:57,695
Oh. That's too bad.

379
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:58,827
[sips]

380
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,394
[coughs]

381
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:04,354
Oh, I hear they're opening
an Olive Garden

382
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:07,140
where the old Sizzler
used to be.On Hampton Road?

383
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,750
Yeah.GEORGE SR.: I don't
think that was a Sizzler.

384
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,186
That was a Chi-Chi's.

385
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,927
No, the Chi-Chi's is on Bedford,

386
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,581
across from
the Payless Shoes.

387
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:16,018
She's right. Because,
one time, we got shoes

388
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,498
and then we got Chi-Chi's.

389
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,021
That was a good day.

390
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,023
GEORGE SR.: Huh. I guess
that was a Sizzler.

391
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,938
I'm sorry they closed that.

392
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,853
Oh, there's still the
other one on Route 40.

393
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,159
Who cares?!

394
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,033
You have a problem?

395
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,339
Yes, I do.
I've had a long day.

396
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:33,949
Is it too much to ask
for a dinner

397
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,429
with a little peace and quiet?

398
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,126
Sheldon, you
do not talk

399
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,606
to your father like that.

400
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,001
Fine. I'd rather not speak
to any of you.

401
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,393
[grunts]

402
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,569
Maybe I better go talk to him.

403
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:46,962
No, I got this.George,

404
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,268
maybe you should
calm down first.

405
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,009
I got this.

406
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,452
You want to
explain yourself?

407
00:16:58,495 --> 00:16:59,975
I'd rather just go to bed,

408
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,195
since I have to be up
in a few hours anyway.

409
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,198
Look, I understand you're tired,
but that is no reason for you...

410
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,417
I'm not just tired.
I'm exhausted.

411
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,549
Everything hurts.

412
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:09,767
I get up in the morning

413
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,031
to do this job
I don't even like.

414
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,728
And I'm doing it
just for the money,

415
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,599
and it's not even
a lot of money.

416
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:18,080
I keep trying harder
and harder,

417
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,082
and it doesn't
even make a difference.

418
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,866
So if you're going
to yell at me or punish me,

419
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,478
let's just get it over with.

420
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,740
[sighs]

421
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,659
I'm not gonna punish you.

422
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,009
Why not? I deserve it.

423
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:39,058
Let me tell you about myday.

424
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,972
I got yelled at
by the principal

425
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,149
for benching a linebacker
who's flunking English.

426
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,977
Then I got yelled at even
more by the kid's parents.

427
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,937
Then I had to break up
a fight in the locker room.

428
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,721
Got elbowed in the neck.

429
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:51,853
That's a rough day.

430
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,855
That was all
before 10:00 a.m.

431
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,685
So I get what you're
going through.

432
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:01,167
But you'll notice, I didn't come
home and take it out on you.

433
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:05,084
No, you didn't.

434
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,694
I want you to get
back in there,

435
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,610
apologize to everyone,
and finish your dinner.

436
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,438
Yes, sir.

437
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,183
ADULT SHELDON: My father's
wisdom touched me deeply.

438
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,880
Which is why, to this day,

439
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,490
no matter
what I'm going through,

440
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,666
I am never irritating
or abusive

441
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,713
to any of my friends
or loved ones.

442
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,889
Ask them. They'll tell you.

443
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,722
ADULT SHELDON:
For the next several months,

444
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,637
I continued working
my paper route

445
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,814
until I paid my father back.

446
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,425
[thunder rumbling]

447
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:45,298
And by "working,"
I mean "delegating."

448
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,174
I have no idea where I am.
