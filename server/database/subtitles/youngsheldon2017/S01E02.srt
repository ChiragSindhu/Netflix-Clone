1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,530
Look at him. Breaks my heart.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,470
Poor little guy,
all alone.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,580
I don't see why

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,710
his brother can't
sit with him.
Come on, Mary.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,390
When you were in high school,
would you have lunch

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,710
with a nine-year-old?
Yes, I would've.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,390
Well, there's something
wrong with you.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,360
I'm gonna keep him company.

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,660
Hey, hey, hey, Mary. Mary.

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,200
Think this through.
Right now the kids

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,220
are just ignoring Sheldon.

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,560
What happens if he's
sitting with his mommy?

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,330
They could mistake me
for a senior.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,490
Well, I look younger than you.

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,930
Just give this time, all right?

16
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,910
It'll work itself out.
(sighs)

17
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,880
ADULT SHELDON:
My mother never understood

18
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,580
that I actually enjoyed
being alone.

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,950
Solitude allowed me to think
about important things,

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,520
like the effect
of gravitational forces

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,860
as you approach
an event horizon,

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,680
as opposed
to less important things,

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,460
like how many grapes my brother
can fit in his mouth.

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,700
(muffled):
14!

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,690
Yeah!
(laughter)

26
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,700
ADULT SHELDON:
Jean-Paul Sartre said,

27
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,240
"Hell is other people."

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,330
(laughs)

29
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,970
That's humorous
because it's true.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,270
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,780
* Yesterday I moved a mountain

32
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,580
* I bet I could be your hero

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,480
* I am a mighty little man

34
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,250
* I am a mighty little man. *

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,570
Something wrong?

37
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,260
How come math is easy
for Sheldon

38
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,440
and hard for me?

39
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,570
I don't know, honey,

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,370
but you have your own gifts.

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,960
Like what?

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Well, like...

43
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,280
...you have very pretty hair.

44
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,270
True.

45
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,580
Georgie.

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,590
Would you do me
a little tiny favor?

47
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,920
Like what?

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,450
Tomorrow at lunch,
would you mind

49
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,590
sitting with your brother?

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,720
Don't do it, Georgie.

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,300
You stay out of this.

52
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,720
I ate with him in second grade.

53
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,770
It really hurt my social life.

54
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,530
(sighs)
Sorry, Mom. Can't do it.

55
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,830
Why are you such a brat?

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,370
Maybe I'm crying for attention.

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,770
This isn't a joke, young lady.

58
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,850
Yes, your brother
may be smart,

59
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,670
but he doesn't have
a friend in the world.

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,610
And I am sorry,
but I am very worried about him.

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,420
Nice going. You're making Mom
a nervous wreck.

62
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,350
What did I do?

63
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,760
You don't have any friends,
and she is beside herself.

64
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,490
But I'm fine without friends.

65
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,870
I don't know what to
tell you, Sheldon.

66
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,760
She said it's your fault.

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,970
I'm going to watch ALF.

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,540
sisters are the worst.

ADULT SHELDON:
When you're three foot ten

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,520
and in high school,

72
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,050
getting from point "A"

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,720
to point "B" can be
a harrowing experience.

74
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,920
* Oh, yeah

75
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,810
* We are the youth gone wild *

76
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,980
* Whoa

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,550
* Whoa... *

78
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,650
ADULT SHELDON: But it's worth it
when point "B" is...

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,460
(exhales)

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
...the library.

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,800
Home to the original
information superhighway,

82
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,760
the Dewey Decimal System.

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,430
MS. HUTCHINS:
Hey there, Sheldon.

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,530
What can I get for you today?

85
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,870
Chemistry?

86
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,110
Quantum mechanics? Astronomy?

87
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,770
No, nothing fun today.

88
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,910
I need to learn
how to make a friend.

89
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,550
Aw, honey,
you having a hard time

90
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,910
adjusting to high school?

91
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,690
I'm having a hard time
adjusting to Earth.

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,830
Yeah. You and me both.

93
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,120
Try this.

94
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,430
It's been around a while,
but it's still quite popular.

95
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,560
Unlike me,

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,740
who's just been around a while.

97
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,840
"How to Win Friends

98
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,070
and Influence People."

99
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,450
This might do it.

100
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,870
"Principle one.

in my quiver.

104
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,580
Thus began
the greatest challenge

105
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,980
of my young life.

106
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,580
Hello, George.

107
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,990
What?

108
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,060
I do admire
your thick head of hair...

109
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,520
George.

110
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,130
Thanks.

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,230
What's going on?

112
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,170
Well, I'm practicing
the principles in this book.

113
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,730
Why?
Well, I know Mom is concerned

114
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,740
that I don't have any friends,

115
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,500
so I'm determined
to remedy the situation.

116
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,910
Oh.

117
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,170
George.

118
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,710
Well, good for you.

119
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,890
Do you feel complimented

120
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,860
when I say your name, George?

121
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,480
The book says you should.
George.

122
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,750
I suppose.

123
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,760
Kind of overdoing it a little.

124
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,750
Sheldon.
Well, thank you

125
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,420
for your criticism.

126
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,760
It also says I should praise

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,940
any improvements
that you've made.

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,930
Okay.

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll get back to you.

130
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,950
George.

131
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,480
ADULT SHELDON:
On the heels

132
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,670
of that successful beta test,

133
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,480
I decided to practice
the Carnegie principles

134
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,590
on someone my own age.

135
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,660
* Hey.

136
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,130
Hello, Billy Sparks.
Hey, Sheldon.

137
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,490
I am genuinely interested
in you

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,490
and would like to encourage you
to talk about yourself.

139
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,000
Billy Sparks.

140
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,430
Thank you.

141
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,240
You have the floor.

142
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,100
Thank you.

143
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,970
ADULT SHELDON: Looking back,
I would've had better luck

144
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,910
making friends
with the chickens.

145
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,620
(bell rings)
Go Wolves.

146
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,850
What?

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,850
You're a cheerleader,
and by saying

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
"Go Wolves,"
I'm initiating a conversation

149
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,820
about something
that interests you.

150
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,600
Oh, are you
one of those special ed kids?

151
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,500
My mom says I'm special.

152
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,230
Would you like to be friends?

153
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,230
I don't think so.

154
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,060
Are you sure?
What if I told you

155
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,610
I admired
your boldly-applied makeup?

156
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,740
* Oh!

157
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,070
SHELDON:
Greetings from stall number one.

158
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,640
As much as I detest
that odd-smelling cigarette,

159
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,880
I do applaud

160
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,020
your rule-breaking
bravado.

161
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,130
My name is Sheldon.
What's yours?

162
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,550
(door closes)

163
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,100
Hello, gentlemen.

164
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,720
Did you watch any sports
programs over the weekend?

165
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,190
* That's what I like about... *

166
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,840
Or perhaps did some kissing
with girls?

167
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,280
* That's what I like
about you... *

168
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,130
Can you hear me?

169
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,270
* Hey! Hey!

170
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,650
* Hey!
MISSY:
95, 96, 97.

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,020
98.

172
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,880
99, 100.

173
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,880
You missed 11 numbers.
I don't need

174
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,290
to be good at math.
I have beautiful hair.

175
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,890
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

176
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,050
Didn't you already
read that book?

177
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,890
I'm reading it again.

178
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,160
How come?

179
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,060
I clearly missed something.

180
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,100
I couldn't find one person
who wanted to be my friend.

181
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,200
Did you look at
the card inside?

182
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,760
Why?

183
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,230
That's just other people
who checked out the book.

184
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,770
It's a list of losers like you
who can't find a friend.

185
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,250
So?

186
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,780
So they're desperate,
and you have their names.

187
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,040
That's brilliant.

188
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,850
Mm.

189
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,280
Now, how is it
that you can't count?

190
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,530
* Well, can't you see her
standing there? *

191
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,240
So your father tells me
you've been reading a new book?

192
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,260
I am. It's about
how to make friends.

193
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,070
Is that something
you're interested in?

194
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,270
Not really, but Missy told me

195
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,740
it makes you sad
that I don't have any.

196
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,200
Oh.

197
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
I got to sew
that girl's mouth shut.

198
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,950
So how's it going?

199
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,090
Well, the principles in the book
didn't work for me at all.

200
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,220
Although Dad does like
being called George

201
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,080
over and over again,
so you might give that a try.

202
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,090
Baby, you don't have
to go to any trouble for me.

203
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
But I like
doing things for you.

204
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,370
You're a nice lady.

205
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,960
But if the book's
not working...
It isn't.

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,700
But I realized
if I find the other people

207
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,760
who checked out the book, they'd
be looking for friends, too.

208
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,870
That's really smart.

209
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,230
Missy thought of it.
You're kidding.

210
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,840
I'm as surprised
as you are.

211
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,380
* Oh, oh-oh, oh.

212
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,840
(distant chatter)

213
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,990
Excuse me, Ms. Ingram?

214
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,980
Sheldon, it's recess.

215
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,990
Go outside, see
what it's like.

216
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,260
Are you
by any chance Evelyn Ingram?

217
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

218
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,120
The same Evelyn Ingram
who checked out this book?

219
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,130
And why is that
your business?
I just

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,690
assumed you were looking
to make a friend.

221
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,130
Oh. (laughs)

222
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,740
Well, that was
a long time ago.

223
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,880
I had just gotten out of a
very difficult relationship.

224
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,230
With a friend?
Friend.

225
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,000
Ha! I gave that man
three years of my life

226
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,340
and my innocence.

227
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,180
I don't know what that means.

228
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,280
It means men are lying dogs
only interested in one thing.

229
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,280
Well, that's not
the dictionary definition.

230
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,890
Mm-hmm.

231
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,420
Always starts the same.

232
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,150
A quick glance across the room,
a casual hand on the shoulder,

233
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,830
lunch at Stuckey's. (laughs)

234
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,830
Oh, yeah, it's
all romance

235
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,290
and flowers in the beginning...

236
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,070
ADULT SHELDON:
The list proved
to be a double-edged sword.

237
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,970
It turns out
self-help books written in 1936

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
were only of interest
to adults.

239
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,340
You're like,
"I'm here because I care.

240
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,400
And by the way, your phone
could make calls, too."

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,040
Then tries to turn
this whole thing around

242
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,310
like it's all
about you being needy,

243
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,040
and you're like,
"Yes, I have needs!

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,890
That's what makes me human!"

245
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,340
ADULT SHELDON:
Emotionally troubled adults.

246
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,010
Child, go outside.

247
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,480
Yes, that's my signature.
Why do you ask?

248
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,920
I'm seeking people
who want to make friends.

249
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,400
I wasn't interested in friends.

250
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,070
I took out that book to help
me become school principal.

251
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,070
Did it work?
Are we sitting in
the principal's office?

252
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
No.
And you know why?

253
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,510
Because Victoria
MacElroy is not a man!

254
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,410
So to be clear, you're not
interested in making friends?

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,010
What I'm interested in
is in living long enough

256
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,220
to see women no longer treated
like second-class citizens.

257
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,910
Well if your goal
is a long life,

258
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,980
that chili cheeseburger is
a step in the wrong direction.

259
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,950
Food is all I have.

260
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,890
ADULT SHELDON:
Like I said,

261
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,100
emotionally troubled adults.

262
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,100
You gonna watch me eat?

263
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,000
Get out of here.

264
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,980
MAN:
Everybody told me,

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,970
"Hubert, don't date
someone from work."

266
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,150
But did I listen? No.

267
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,010
Let me tell you something.
She likes to say

268
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,270
I stole her innocence?

269
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,910
Well, what about my innocence?

270
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,120
I was never the same
after we broke up.

271
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,550
ADULT SHELDON:
Two years later,

272
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,810
Mr. Givens became
the high school principal,

273
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,920
which might be why Ms. MacElroy
became morbidly obese.

274
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,450
I had the brains, I had the
charm, and I don't like to brag,

275
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,430
but I was pretty easy
on the eyes back then.

276
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,470
That woman got herself
one heck of a package.

277
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,760
But some people don't
want to be satisfied.

278
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,170
Is that any good?

279
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm afraid not.

280
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,880
I failed to make
a single friend.

281
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,570
That sucks. I have a tough time
making friends, too.

282
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,410
The worst part is, it
was important to my mom.

283
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,270
My parents pressure me about
making friends all the time.

284
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,410
So you understand
what I'm going through.

285
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,190
Oh, I read that book.
It's excellent.

286
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,490
Are you into rocketry?

287
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,130
I started with
water propulsion,

288
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,860
worked my way up
to solid fuel,

289
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,450
then went back to water after
I set our garage on fire.

290
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,190
Nice.
I also tried to
get some uranium

291
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,040
and build an atomic engine,
but that stuff's hard to find.

292
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,610
Probably for the best.

293
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,030
Well, good luck on your
quest to find a friend.

294
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,400
You, too.

295
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,880
If you haven't found one
yet, I have good news.

296
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,090
Mom, what do you know
about the drug Prozac?

297
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,350
Not much.

298
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,100
Supposed to make
people happier. Why?

299
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,490
I was just thinking

300
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,900
some of my teachers
might benefit from it.

301
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,340
Speaking of which,

302
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,390
you'll be happy to know
I made a friend today.

303
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,600
Oh.

304
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,400
Well, that's nice.

305
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,880
But, as I said,
this isn't for me.

306
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,310
It's for you.

307
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,600
He made a friend!

308
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,210
He did it!

309
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,610
Our little boy has got a friend.

310
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,390
Who is it?
Who cares?

311
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,490
It's a human being.
It's a warm body.

312
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,220
(knocks)
SHELDON:
Mom?

313
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,320
Yes, honey?

314
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,350
Can I come in?
Of course.

315
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,600
Be cool.

316
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,450
What's up, sweetie?
I was wondering

317
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,090
when I could continue
my rocketry hobby.

318
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,970
Uh, Sheldon,
we've been through this.

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
You can build them.
You just can't launch them.

320
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,110
But launching them
is the fun part.

321
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,310
Tell that to the family
of squirrels

322
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,540
who died in the fire.

323
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,730
Okay.

324
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,370
It was just something I was
hoping to do with my new friend.

325
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,580
Hang on.

326
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,050
Uh, yes.

327
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,150
It's fine.

328
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,180
Ban is lifted.

329
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,410
Mary...
It's for his friend.

330
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,450
He's got a friend.

331
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,690
Besides,
those could have been rats.

332
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,420
Their bodies
were so badly burned.

333
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,620
I thought we were being cool,
but okay.

334
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,800
Hey, here's an idea.

335
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,960
Why don't you invite your
new buddy over for dinner?

336
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,160
Why?
Well, honey,

337
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,600
um, that is what friends do.

338
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,430
My mother asked
me to ask you

339
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,340
if you'd like to
join us for dinner.

340
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,180
Why?
I was hoping you'd know.

341
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,090
MARY:
He's here!

342
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,710
Everybody, stay calm!
Just a normal day,

343
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,160
just a normal dinner.
MISSY:
Can I eat in front of the TV?

344
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,630
MARY: No, you can eat
in front of Sheldon's friend.

345
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,420
MISSY:
Aw, fudge.
I know what "fudge" means,

346
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,700
and you are right
on the edge, young lady.

347
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,560
Welcome.

348
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,080
GEORGE SR.:
So, uh...

349
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,180
Tam. What kind of name is that?

350
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,550
Vietnamese. Sir.

351
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,110
Sure. You know, I spent
a little time over there.

352
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,310
Army.

353
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,190
Your mom's name isn't
Kim-Lee, is it?

354
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,720
No. Sir.

355
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,320
Good.

356
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,180
I mean, you know,
it's a small country.

357
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,490
(chuckles):
So...

358
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,220
Mary, how's that food coming?

359
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,270
MARY:
Almost.

360
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,420
So, Vietnam, like in Rambo.

361
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,590
Yes.
That's a cool movie.

362
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,590
Yes.

363
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,730
Are you in it?

364
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,640
No.
Hmm.

365
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,040
Why would you think
you knew his mom?

366
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,600
MARY:
All right, Tam.

367
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,470
I decided I was gonna make
you a real Texas dinner.

368
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,320
Barbecued chicken and brisket.

369
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,520
Thank you.

370
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,120
Well, I figured
you were probably tired

371
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,060
of stuff wiggling around
on your plate.

372
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,350
Okay, let's say grace.

373
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,620
Now, Tam, when I say "Jesus,"

374
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,780
feel free to say the word
"Buddha" in your head.

375
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm actually Catholic.

376
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,660
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

377
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,360
Thank you, God,
for this food,

378
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,720
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

379
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,260
And thank you so much
for Sheldon's new friend.

380
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,510
ALL:
Amen.

381
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,270
So, Tam, tell us
about your family.

382
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,170
What brings y'all to Texas?

383
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,150
Well, after the American War...

384
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,250
You mean the Vietnam War.

385
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,780
We call it the American War.

386
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,370
Hmm.
Anyway,

387
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,740
after the war, my
father was sent

388
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,240
to a reeducation camp

389
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,440
because he fought
on the wrong side.

390
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,510
You mean our side.

391
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,250
I was trying to be nice.

392
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,390
So, for many years,

393
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,190
my mother and my
sisters and I

394
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,690
were very poor

395
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,390
and very often
didn't have much to eat.

396
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,630
Then, when he was released...

397
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,530
What'd they teach him
at the reeducation camp?

398
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,060
How to be a communist.

399
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,800
Cool, like in Rambo.

400
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,100
(chuckles nervously)

401
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,210
When he was released,

402
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,810
we escaped on a small boat

403
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,550
and spent many weeks at sea
dodging Cambodian pirates

404
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,220
until we reached Thailand.

405
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,140
Oh, that's supposed to be
a beautiful country.

406
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,610
Lovely beaches.
TAM:
I wouldn't know.

407
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,760
We were forced to live
in a refugee camp,

408
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,220
where the only thing we had
to eat were pigeons and rats.

409
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,560
Ha! That's a job for hot sauce.

410
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,430
Finally,

411
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,290
we were allowed
to come to United States

412
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,700
and start over in Galveston.

413
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,660
My father saved money
and bought his own shrimp boat.

414
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,510
There's a happy ending. Huh?

415
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,640
See, kids?
When the going gets tough,

416
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,840
America provides.
TAM:
It did.

417
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,570
Until the Ku Klux Klan
burned our boat

418
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,450
and chased us away.

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,150
You gonna put a good spin
on that one?

420
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,310
So we came to Medford

421
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,680
and opened up
a convenience store.

422
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,330
My parents work 16 hours a day,

423
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,150
seven days a week

424
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,500
for very little money.

425
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,660
Well, that was depressing.

426
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,170
I don't understand
why it didn't launch.

427
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,480
Me, neither.

428
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,450
Evil Nazi scientists
did it 50 years ago.

429
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,190
How hard could it be?

430
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,410
(doorbell rings)

431
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,310
Can I help you?

432
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,650
Sorry to bother you, ma'am. FBI.

433
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,800
We're looking
for a Sheldon Lee Cooper.

434
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,650
George!

435
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,190
GEORGE SR.:
I'm on the can.

436
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,400
Now!
(door opens)

437
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,500
What?
These gentlemen

438
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,200
are with the FBI.
They want to talk to Sheldon.

439
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,810
What?

440
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,410
We... Uh...

441
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,940
Y-You fellas
must have made a mistake.

442
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,500
Sheldon's nine.

443
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,800
Well, someone living
at this address

444
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,370
recently called a mining
operation in Canada

445
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,510
and tried to buy uranium.

446
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,220
Okay, maybe it's not a mistake.

447
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,490
It's ridiculous.

448
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,790
Let's just go talk to him.

449
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,720
Huh?

450
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,420
He's just a little,
itty-bitty thing.

451
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,680
Really, he's harmless.

452
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,530
SHELDON:
Sorry!

453
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,190
He's in the garage.
