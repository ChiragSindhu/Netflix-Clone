00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,960
They're fighting about money.

179
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,470
It's a common argument
in marriages.

180
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,170
(door opens)

181
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,900
Lights out.

182
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,610
Big day tomorrow.

183
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,840
Mom?

184
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,050
Hmm?

185
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,280
Do we have financial problems?

186
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,010
Don't you worry about that.

187
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,420
We are fine.

188
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,990
Now, go to sleep.

189
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,560
(sighs)

190
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,200
She's lying. She just said that
to make you feel better.

191
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,490
Mom doesn't lie.

192
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,160
Sure, she thinks

193
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,860
the Earth was made in six days,

194
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,070
but that's 'cause
she's gullible, not a liar.

195
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,800
MISSY:
<i>Mom,</i>

196
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,140
Sheldon can't find his bowtie.

197
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,010
Really? I laid it out for him.

198
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,210
Leave it alone, Mary.
He doesn't need a bowtie.

199
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,880
It's his first day of school.
Let him wear what he wants.

200
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,580
SHELDON:
Mom, I can't
find my bowtie!

201
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,560
Dear Lord, why's he
got to wear a bowtie?

202
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,090
Can I drive in with you?

203
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,850
Sure.

204
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,560
Everybody's gonna know
he's your brother.

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
It's gonna be awful for you.

206
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
Tell her to shut up.

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,160
She's not wrong.

208
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,770
(TV plays quietly)

209
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,705
It's got to be here.
SHELDON:
It's not.

210
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,570
It's not!
Shelly, stay calm.
We'll find it.

211
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,100
My tie is gone!
My tie is gone!
Shelly,

212
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,745
you don't really need a tie.

213
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,840
I have to find my tie.
I have to find my tie.

214
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,440
Be right back.

215
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,150
Professor Proton wears a bowtie!

216
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,350
George Junior,

217
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,950
give me back that
bowtie right now!
I didn't take it!

218
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,920
Don't you lie to me!
I'm not lying!

219
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,090
We'll see about that.
Stay out of my room!

220
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,060
She's gonna find
your dirty magazines.

221
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,360
Shut up!

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,660
You are not having a good day.

223
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,940
(sighs)

224
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,530
(sighs)

225
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,170
Ugh!

226
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,140
(sighs)

227
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,270
Hey. Hey,
he didn't take it.

228
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,740
Then what
happened to it?!
SHELDON:
Help me find my bowtie!

229
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll check in
the bathroom!

230
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,280
I took it.

231
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,360
Why would you do that?
Mary,

232
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,160
the boy is nine years old
and going into high school.

233
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,530
Isn't that weird enough?

234
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,190
Give it to me.
Come on.

235
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,620
It's not just Sheldon.

236
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,470
Georgie's gonna be
in class with him.

237
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,260
Not in the bathroom!

238
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,130
Give it.

239
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,560

240
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,300

Would you like
to play a driving game?

243
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,080
Not really. I always lose.

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,110
I know. That's why it's fun.
(laughs)

245
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,760
How about license plates
with prime numbers

246
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,160
followed by
a cons...?
Why don't we just talk?

247
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,230
Very well.

248
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,260
You understand

249
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,590
that some people are gonna be
intimidated by you

250
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
'cause of how smart you are?

251
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,100
Or maybe
they'll recognize my intellect

252
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,730
and make me their leader.

253
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,140
Lord, look after my son.

254
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,410

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,050
(distorted speech)

259
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,380
Oh, dear.

260
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,760
Yeah.

261
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,090
That boy has
an exposed tattoo.

262
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,520
He does.

263
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,900
I wonder if he knows

264
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,670
that's in violation
of the dress code.

265
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,360
Speaking of which, how
about we lose the bowtie?

266
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,040
Why?

267
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,610
Look around, honey. None of the
other kids are wearing one.

268
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,710
Well, perhaps I'll start a fad.

269
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,880
No, you won't.
Please trust Mommy.

270
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,370
All right,
tell you what.

271
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,880
You take it off,
and this weekend,

272
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,310
I'll take you to RadioShack.

273
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,690
Hmm?

274
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,820
(bell ringing)

275
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,150
(indistinct chatter)

276
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,990
(growling)

277
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,390
You doing okay?

278
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,460
I guess.

279
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,520
(roars)

280
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,060
I smell ammonia.

281
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,610
They must've done
a thorough cleaning recently.

282
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,260
I like that.

283
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,900
MARY: And remember, if anybody
bothers you, what do you say?

284
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,940
My dad's a football coach.

285
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,140
And?
My brother's a football player.

286
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,350
Good.

287
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,680
Hey, Mom, look.

288
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,040
That girl's pregnant.

289
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,580
Congratulations.

290
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,750
(toilet flushing)

291
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,230
Well, that was revolting.

292
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,895
All right.
This is your homeroom.

293
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:02,460
Do you want me
to go in with you?

294
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,560
No. Although I could've used you
in the restroom.

295
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,700
Okay, well...

296
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,000
You have a good day.

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,530
And I'll pick you up
after school,

298
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,110
same door we came in.

299
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,780
Are you crying or having
an allergy attack?

300
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,040
Allergies.

301
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,740
It's probably the ammonia.

302
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,610
Probably.
(sniffles)

303
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,610
Okay. Let the learning begin.

304
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,730
(exhales)

305
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,060
All right, everybody,
my name is Ms. MacElroy.

306
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,230
In addition to being
your homeroom teacher,

307
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,030
I'll be seeing some of you
in my English class,

308
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
and some of you
on the volleyball court.

309
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,910
Just to give you
a little history,

310
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,980
I've been here at Medford
for 29 years...

311
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,370
(mouthing)

312
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,380
...I taught some of your
older brothers and sisters,

313
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,520
and sadly,
some of your parents.

314
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,610
Not much I haven't seen.

315
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,620
Until today.

316
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,860
I'm sure you're well aware
we have a student with us,

317
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,860
who, despite his young age,

318
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,160
is remarkably gifted.

319
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,370
And I expect y'all
to make him feel welcome.

320
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,500
Yes, Sheldon?

321
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,170
Per the student dress
and grooming code,

322
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,170
this boy's hair is too long,

323
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,105
this boy is wearing
sports attire

324
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,470
outside
of a designated area

325
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,000
and this girl's blouse
is diaphanous,

326
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,980
which means
I can see her brassiere.

327
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,010
(laughter)
Thank you.

328
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,910
I will take that
into account.

329
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,250
All right.

330
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,410
We have a few minutes
before first period.

331
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,520
I need y'all
to fill out these forms.

332
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,780
What?

333
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,930
Also in violation of the
grooming code on page 48,

334
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,960
article five, subsection B,

335
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,060
you have a bit of a mustache.

336
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,390
(laughter)

337
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,690
This is a stupid idea.
This boy does not

338
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,830
belong in our school.

339
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,770
PETERSEN: Come on Vicky,
it's just the first day.

340
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,870
Why don't we all just take
a deep breath here?

341
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,170
The hell with that. Five
minutes into my math class,

342
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,940
he questioned my credentials.

343
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,670
How am I supposed to control a
classroom when a kid accuses me

344
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,610
of being in breach
of the hygiene code?

345
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,380
Well, Hubert, it wouldn't
kill you to shower

346
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,010
a little more often. George,
you want to weigh in here?

347
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,855
Well...
INGRAM:
Oral Roberts University

348
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,110
is a wonderful school.

349
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,950
He said I was intimidated
by his intelligence,

350
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,890
and then,

351
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,790
he offered to be my "leader."

352
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,560
(clears throat)

353
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,090
(playing Mozart's Sonata in D)

354
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,420
(piano playing)

355
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
(stops playing)

356
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,710
Do you know
this sonata?

357
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,980
No.

358
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,050
How long have you
played the piano?

359
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,840
I don't play piano.

360
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,080
PETERSEN:
<i>George,</i>

361
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,640
you got any thoughts here?

362
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,810
I certainly do.

363
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,160
Mary, tell him.

364
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,020
It's simple.
We don't have a choice.

365
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,490
Well, you gave it a shot.

366
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,590
We wish you luck
with Sheldon elsewhere...

367
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,090
MARY:
No, no, no.

368
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,500
We don't have a choice.

369
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,900
He's got to stay here.

370
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,270
We can't afford

371
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,240
private school.

372
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
I sure can't
homeschool him.

373
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,010
He's doing calculus and
Euclidean something or other.

374
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,210
Euclidean geometry.

375
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,810
Guess where I learned that.

376
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,080
Yeah, yeah, we know.

377
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,780
All I care about
is that

378
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,950
my son gets the education
he deserves, so you all

379
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,150
are gonna have to
figure this out.

380
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,890
Coach, can you help me out here,
please?

381
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,310
'Cause I'm dyin'.

382
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,560
I'd rather not.

383
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,520
G minor.

384
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,930
F.

385
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,300
E flat.

386
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,340
C minor.

387
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,100
You have perfect pitch.

388
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,570
Okay.

389
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,250
Sweetheart, you should
really pursue music.

390
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,220
No, thank you.
Musicians take drugs.

391
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,230
Is there a faculty
restroom I could use?

392
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,660
(whistle blows)

393
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,160
♪ Ooh... ♪

394
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,290
(grunting)

395
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,420
♪ Ooh... ♪

396
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,610
Cooper, Stinson, you're up.

397
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,170
(laughs) Hey, look,
it's the dumb brother.

398
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,540
Okay.
(blows whistle)

399
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,380
(grunting, yelling)

400
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,640
(whistle blowing)

401
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,010
BERGDOFF:
That's enough. Hey.

402
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,860
(yelling)
(whistle blowing)

403
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,280
BERGDOFF:
Hey, that's enough!

404
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,730
Hey, hey!
GEORGE SR.:
That's enough!

405
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,990
Georgie.

406
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,720
Georgie! Georgie!

407
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,300
Stop! Stop!

408
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,870
What the hell
is wrong with you?

409
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,840
You okay?

410
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
No, I'm not okay.

411
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,250
Where you think you're going?

412
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,210
I quit. I don't want
to play anymore!

413
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,590
Since when?
Since right now!

414
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,290
All right, what is going on?

415
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,050
What do you think's going on?!

416
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,570
You mean Sheldon?

417
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,190
You can't let that bother you.

418
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,630
It doesn't bother you?

419
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,430
You got called
to the principal's office.

420
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,310
Yeah, that wasn't so great.

421
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,040
I can't be in the same school
as him!

422
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,970
Well, I don't see
what choice you have.

423
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,520
Right. Ever since he could talk,
I quit having any choices.

424
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,780
(groans)

425
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,950
I know it's hard.

426
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm telling you, as your coach,
quit your whining,

427
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,390
get your uniform on and you
get your ass back out there.

428
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,390
But what about as my dad?

429
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,030
Your dad is
having a bad day.

430
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,460
Listen to your coach.

431
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,000
Can a clock be powered
by an ordinary potato?

432
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,870
I hope so, boys and girls,

433
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,080
or this is going to be
a really boring episode.

434
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,250
The supplies you'll need...

435
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,080
Why can't we
watch<i> DuckTales?</i>

436
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,330
'Cause we don't learn anything
watching<i> DuckTales.</i>

437
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,850
It's TV; we aren't
supposed to learn.

438
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,590
...two alligator grips
and, let's see...

439
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Of course, a clock.

440
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,140
Missy, go somewhere else.
I need to talk to your brother.

441
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,960
Why don't you go somewhere else
and I can watch<i> Duck...</i>

442
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,170
Go!

443
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,270
I hate everybody.

444
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,010
It's time for science.

445
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,420
Hey, he was about to power
a clock with a potato.

446
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,150
Not possible.

447
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,210
Now, listen...
Am I in trouble?

448
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,520
No.

449
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,080
Maybe. Just listen.

450
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,250
You're not gonna
make it in this school

451
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,920
if you keep ratting
people out.

452
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,570
But they were breaking
the grooming codes

453
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,190
and the dress codes.

454
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,600
I saw one boy with a T-shirt
that said...

455
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,330
(whispering):
"Bite me."

456
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,040
Yeah. That-that's terrible.

457
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,810
Sheldon, let me tell
you a little story.

458
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,950
Did you ever wonder why we moved
from Galveston to Medford?

459
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,540
No. I tend to wonder
about the bigger questions.

460
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,850
Okay, well, here's why.

461
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,690
Your dad had a real good
coaching job

462
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,090
and I saw some grown-ups
breaking rules.

463
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,890
What'd they do?

464
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,020
I-It's kind of complicated,
but...

465
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,900
football coaches aren't allowed
to recruit kids

466
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,960
from other high schools
to play on their teams.

467
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,060
And you told on them?

468
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah. You know what happened?

469
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,400
Justice descended
upon the rule breakers?

470
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,900
I got fired, Sheldon.

471
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,940
And I got a bad
reputation.

472
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,840
Oh. That's why you
drink so much beer.

473
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,280
Just do yourself a favor.

474
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,680
Okay? Go to
school tomorrow,

475
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,120
and mind your own business.

476
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,720
All right?

477
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,390
Dad.

478
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,130
Are you sad that you got fired?

479
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,860
Mostly angry.

480
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,140
But yeah.

481
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,110
Maybe a little sad.

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,680
Thank you, God,

485
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,560

What's that, baby?

498
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,770
In a world filled

499
